# book-hunter-and-saver

## Description
Book-hunter-and-saver is an app that uses Google Books API search engine to allow logged-in users to save books into their personalized collections. 

My challenge was to refactor the search engine from RESTful API to GraphQL API, built with Apollo Server and using the MERN stack.
