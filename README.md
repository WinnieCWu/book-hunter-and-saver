# book-hunter-and-saver

## Description
Book-hunter-and-saver is an app that uses Google Books API search engine to allow users to save books into their personalized collections. 

My challenge was to refactor the search engine with RESTful API to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. It was built using the MERN stack. 

Users can start the app by running 'npm run develop' in the root directory.
